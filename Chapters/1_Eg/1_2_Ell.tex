\section{Mordell's Equation}

In this section, we study the Diophantine equation
\begin{align}
    y^2 = x^3 + 16
    \label{Ch1:Eq:Mordell_Eg}
\end{align}
We begin by observing that there is a trivial case: when $x = 0$, we can see that $y = \pm 4$.

\subsection{The Case where $x \neq 0$ and $y$ is Odd}

We begin by rewriting~\eqref{Ch1:Eq:Mordell_Eg} and factoring: we have
\begin{align*}
    x^3 = y^2 - 16 = \parenth{y + 4}\parenth{y - 4}
\end{align*}
It turns out that $\pgcd{y - 4, y + 4} = 1$: one can show that if $y - 4$ and $y + 4$ have a prime divisor, then that prime would have to be $2$, making $y$ even, a contradiction.
